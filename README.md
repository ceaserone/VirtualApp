## Features

- **App Cloning** — Run multiple instances of any app simultaneously
- **Android 5.0–14 Support** — Tested and working on Android 14 (API 34)
- **Xposed Modules** — Load Xposed modules without root (auto-disabled on Android 14 due to ART changes)
- **32-bit & 64-bit** — Builds for `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a`
- **No Root Required** — Everything runs within a single host APK
- **IO Redirection** — Transparent file path remapping for cloned apps
- **UID Virtualization** — Each cloned app gets its own virtual identity
- **Search** — Find apps quickly when cloning with built-in search
- **Modern UI** — Clean Material Design home screen

## Android 14 Highlights

This fork includes 15+ patches making VirtualApp work on Android 14:

| Category | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| Native | ARM64 BTI landing pad for inline hooks (fixes SIGILL) |
| Native | `@CriticalNative` safe `getCallingUid` hook (fixes SIGSEGV) |
| Native | 32-bit ARM `__NR_fstatat64` syscall fix for `armeabi-v7a` |
| Java | Android 14 `ClientTransactionHandler` method overloads (fixes AbstractMethodError) |
| Java | `ArraySet` handling for `IntentFilter.mActions` and `protectedBroadcasts` |
| Java | `getVolumeList` userId fix for API 33+ |
| Parsing | Pure-reflection `PackageParser` fallback for broken mirrors |
| Parsing | APK re-parse on cache corruption (fixes disappearing apps) |
| Xposed | Auto-disable on API 34+ with Settings toggle |
| UI | Redesigned home screen, splash screen, clone app search |

See [docs/FIXES.md](docs/FIXES.md) for complete technical details.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| JDK | 17 |
| Android SDK | API 34 |
| Android NDK | 21.4.7075529 |
| Gradle | 7.5 (wrapper included) |

### Build

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone <repo-url> VirtualApp
cd VirtualApp

# Build debug APK (produces per-ABI splits + universal)
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Output in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`:
```
VirtualApp-1.0.0-arm64-v8a.apk
VirtualApp-1.0.0-armeabi-v7a.apk
VirtualApp-1.0.0-universal.apk
```

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install arm64 split (recommended for modern devices)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/VirtualApp-1.0.0-arm64-v8a.apk

# Install armeabi-v7a for 32-bit devices
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/VirtualApp-1.0.0-armeabi-v7a.apk

# Or universal (works on all architectures)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/VirtualApp-1.0.0-universal.apk

adb shell monkey -p io.va.exposed64 -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1
```

See [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for detailed build instructions.

## Known Issues

- **Xposed modules** do not work on Android 14 (Epic/SandHook incompatible with ART changes)
- **Fake signatures** used when certificate parsing fails (some apps may detect tampering)
- **SELinux denials** for certain vendor properties (non-fatal)
- **External storage** creation may fail under scoped storage restrictions

See [docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for the full list.

## Contributing

1. Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the codebase
2. Read [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) to set up your environment
3. Check [docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md](docs/KNOWN-ISSUES.md) for things that need fixing
4. When modifying native code, always delete `lib/build` before rebuilding
5. Test on a real Android 14 device — emulators may not reproduce all issues
